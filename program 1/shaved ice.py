## PROBLEM: A poor man would like to make a shave ice stand and would like
##          to simulate how the shave ice stand would do over the course
##          of ten days
##          
## ALGORITHM : 
##Import random module
##Initialize Keep_playing to True
##While Keep_playing is true
##	Budget is 5
##	Cup_cost is .5
##	For day in range from 1 to 10
##		Temp is random.randint from 70 to 100
##		If random.randint from 1 to 10 is 1
##			Rain is True
##			Say it is temp degrees and it is raining
##		Else
##			Say it is temp degrees and isnâ€™t raining
##		Price is 0
##		Cups is 0
##		While price is 0
##			Ask how much you want to charge per cup and assign it to price
##			If price is less than 0
##				Say you have to charge zero or more
##		While cups*cup_cost is greater than budget
##                    While cups is 0
##				Ask how many cups they want to make and assign it to cups
##				If cups is less than 0
##					Say you have to make zero or more cups
##			If cup_cost*cups is greater than budget
##				Say you cant make more cups than you have money to make
##				While cups is 0
##					Ask how many cups they want to make and assign it to cups
##					If cups is less than 0
##						Say you have to make zero or more cups
##		Max_customers is temp-70*.5/price
##		If raining
##			Max_customers is max_customers times one half
##		Customers is random.randint from 0 to max_customers
##		Cups_sold is customers minus the difference between customers and cups
##		Budget is budget minus the difference of price times cups_sold minus the product of cups and cup_cost
##		Say you sold cups_sold and earned customers times cups_sold and you have budget dollars left
##	Ask if they want to continue and assign to continue
##	If continue is y or yes
##		Keep_playing is True
##	Elif continue is n or no
##		Keep_playing is False
##	Else 
##		Ask if they want to continue y or n
## 
## 
## ERROR HANDLING: None
